# NYPL Digital Collections Metadata Quality Stats

This repository contains scripts, analyses, and reports related to ongoing metadata quality work with NYPL's Digital Collections metadata.  

[items-min-mandatory](https://github.com/NYPL/metadata-stats/tree/master/items-min-mandatory) includes scoring scripts, data analysis and a [report](https://github.com/NYPL/metadata-stats/blob/master/items-min-mandatory/items-min-mandatory_report_2017-01-10.pdf) on the first phase of a metadata audit looking at how well legacy metadata meets baseline standards.   

For more information on metadata quality at NYPL Metadata Services Unit, read our [presentation](http://bit.ly/NYPLmetadataMETRO17) from the 2017 METRO conference.
